## Welcome to Conversions API


The Conversions API creates a connection between an advertiser’s marketing data and the Meta systems that optimize ad targeting, decrease cost per action and measure results. In the case of direct integrations, this entails establishing a connection between an advertiser’s server and Meta.

Server events are linked to a Meta Pixel ID and are processed like web events sent via Pixel. This means that web server events are used in measurement, reporting, and optimization in a similar way as browser Pixel events.

For optimal ad performance, we recommend that advertisers implement the Conversions API alongside their Meta Pixel and follow other best practices.


### Recommended Steps


1. Get Started: Choose the integration method that works best for you, see prerequisites for using the API, and understand where to begin.
2. Implement the API and start sending requests: Start making POST requests and learn more about dropped events, batch requests, and event transaction time.
3. Verify your setup: Confirm that we have received your events and that events are deduplicated and matched correctly.
